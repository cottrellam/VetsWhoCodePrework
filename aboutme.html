          <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>
            I was born and raised in a small town in northcentral Indiana. In my
          early years we lived on a small hobby farm. We had a couple of cows,
          some geese, chickens, and rabbits. My first car was a Dodge Dart
          Swinger. I was on the dive team in high school. I love riding my
          skateboard all over town. My first computer was a Commodore Vic-20. I
          used that to learn basic when I was about 11-12. </p>
          <p>
          When I turned 18 I joined the Navy and became an electronics tech. I was stationed on the
          USS Orion in Sardignia Italy. 
        </p>
        <p>

            When I got out of the Navy I stayed
          around in Norfolk, Virginia where I met my future and current spouse.
          We moved from Virginia to Indiana where I started working as tech
          support for a local internet provider. This is where I first started
          learning html. After that we moved to San Diego, California where I
          worked in the health insurance industry.  Then we moved to Indianapolis where I learned PHP and developed web applications using the LAMP stack.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then got a job as a software developer at Regis Corporation in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  This is where I developed my
            my coding skills with C# and Angular.

          <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
          <p>Regis Corporation, Minneapolis, MN</p>

          <p>April 2008 â€“ February 2023</p>
          <p>
            The beauty industry's global leader in beauty salons and cosmetology
            education. The Company franchises, owns, or holds ownership
            interests in more than 5,500 locations worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>Senior Software Engineer</p>
          <p>
            Design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain various software
            applications using various technology stacks.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Created a suite of intranet tools using Angular and .NET to make
              managing and monitoring systems easier. As a result the team was
              able to immediately identify when systems broke down and where the
              issue was.
            </li>

            <li>
              Created a bot using Dialogflow, AngularJS, and NodeJS with AWS
              Lambda functions to allow easy access to data for our field
              employees as well as our helpdesk. Call times for related issues
              were reduced by 80%.
            </li>

            <li>
              Developed a generic CRUD using Razor and .NET to allow users to
              manage data without having to spin up a separate UI to manage each
              project. This allowed us to create a new CRUD UI in a matter of
              minutes instead of a week or two.
            </li>

            <li>
              Worked with a team to create an ETL using SSIS to migrate salons
              to our new POS.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed several web applications using Angular: employee
              reviews, systems monitors, reports.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed and maintained several APIs using .NET to get data from
              our DB2, MSSQL, and MySQL backend systems.
            </li>

            <li>
              Worked as part of a team to develop and deploy a POS using a WAMP
              stack.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed ETLs to clean bad data in our ERP using PHP with DB2.
            </li>
            <li>
              Used Python to create AWS Cloudwatch dashboards and alarms and
              deployed using code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborated with other development teams and departments to
              define application requirements.
            </li>
          </ul>
